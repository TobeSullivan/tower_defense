## ⚠️ Recent reversals — do NOT act on stale instructions
- **Platform: PC/Mac-first. Mobile NEVER** (console if it succeeds; mobile only on viral success). Mobile would be a *fork*, not a port.
- **Board is 25×14** (locked + implemented). The old 20×11 mobile shrink is dead.
- **In-match UI = the 2026-06-05/06 v3 bounded layout** (recessed surround + bright bordered board, right inspector dock, redesigned victory panel).
- **Pricing: $10–15 (PC band).** Saves = Steam Cloud.
- **No disposable intermediates (NEW 2026-06-06).** We build toward the end state, not throwaway rungs. itch.io beta is DEAD → **closed Steam beta** is the target. Re-sim/anti-cheat and real queue-based multiplayer (Option B) are **pulled forward**, not deferred. See `notes/open_items.md` "session 3".

## Name
**"Wend"** (locked). Subtitle carries genre. **Modes: Trials (PVE), Ranked (PVP).**
**Trials scale names: Thread · Weave · Tangle · Snarl · Knot** (1→5, locked 2026-06-06).

## Steam (closed beta) — account status [2026-06-07]
First step toward the closed Steam beta is taken: **Steamworks partner account registered** against the existing personal Steam account (long-standing, Steam Guard on).
- **Entity type:** registered as dev/publisher — individual-vs-company choice NOT confirmed in chat. **CONFIRM** which was selected (matters for tax/bank + later restructure).
- **$100 Steam Direct fee: PAID.** → **30-day release clock is running.** Earliest possible main-game release ≈ **2026-07-07**.
- **Tax (W-9, MI) + bank (checking / USD / US): submitted.** → **Identity Verification Pending, 2–7 business days** (third-party service Lilaham/TaxIdentity). Cannot change tax/bank info or finish account creation until it clears.

**Blocked until verification clears (next actionable Steam step):**
1. Create the **Wend App ID** (the main game app).
2. Create the **Playtest app** off it — Associated Packages & DLC page → set Library capsule image + visible name ("Wend - Playtest") → walk the release-process checklist.

**Open decision to make next session (drives the Playtest config):**
- **Confidential / friends-only:** Playtest App ID + request Standard Release keys + set Playtest Playable + Store Visibility Hidden. No public page, no 2-week wait, nothing leaks. Hand keys directly to testers. *(Likely the right call for a few-friends beta.)*
- **Public Coming Soon page + Playtest signup button:** more setup, reveals Wend publicly, and the store page must be live ≥2 weeks before main-game release — but starts banking wishlists immediately.

(Steam *closed-beta mechanics* design — what the beta build actually contains/tests — remains a separate open design thread; see below.)

---

## Current focus
**Design session 4 done (2026-06-06): orchestration + Trials lobby + campaign rework specced.** Two new docs + three file edits ready for CC:
- `notes/matchmaking_orchestration.md` (NEW) — the orchestration spine. Coordinator = Nakama match handler; re-sim = async headless-Godot workers. Ranked: queue → forming lobby (fills X/8, **unanimous-of-present vote at 4–7, abstain = no, no timeout**, auto-launch at 8) → instant-join (no ready-check) → run → validate (re-sim authoritative) → settle → teardown. Speed-beats-quality matching (safe because LP is MMR-anchored). Floor = 4. Post-launch drop = forfeit. Crash = void/no-LP. Trials routes through the same spine minus elimination.
- `design/CAMPAIGN.md` (NEW) — five-mission curriculum (ramp from zero, fixing the inverted old M1), the tutorial-beat system, the ghost-outline build-guidance spec, real tutorial copy. Old 10-mission `.tres` deprecated.
- `design/DESIGN_MODES.md` (EDIT) — Trials reconciled (host launches, no ready-up gate; group size = board, no scoring vote; individual-while-grouped deferred); campaign cut to five w/ pointer to CAMPAIGN.md; PVP nav points at orchestration doc; **40×22→25×14 grid drift flagged**.
- `notes/open_items.md`, `STATE.md` (EDIT) — backlog + state updated.

**Earlier (session 3): the MP + leaderboard spine** — `notes/resim_contract.md`, `leaderboard_schema.md`, `ghost_ladder.md`, `leaderboard_ui_spec.md` + mockups. Identity: Steam auth → Nakama, one identity, display name = Steam persona.

## Next step

### ▶▶ NEXT SESSION — wire the Godot client to the (now-deployed) Nakama
**Assume the user has deployed the Nakama stack** (`deploy/nakama/`) to the resized Hetzner box (178.156.171.215) and it's live: console at `:7351`, client API at `:7350`, server key set in `.env`, the 5 campaign + `ranked_s1` + 60 `trials_*` boards visible in the console. **First thing: confirm it's actually up** before building — ask the user for the deploy log / console screenshot, or have them run `docker compose exec nakama /nakama/nakama healthcheck`. If it's NOT deployed, the gating steps are in `deploy/nakama/README.md` §0–2.

Then build, in order (each testable against the live instance):
1. **nakama-godot client + device auth** — vendor the `com.heroiclabs.nakama` addon into `src/addons/`, add a `NakamaClient` autoload that connects with the server key, does **device auth** (Steam later), persists the session token (SaveData), exposes a socket. Verify: a real auth + `getAccount` round-trip headless against `:7350`.
2. **`NakamaBackend`** (`src/scripts/nakama_backend.gd`) — same `fetch_*` methods as `LeaderboardService.LocalBackend`, reading via `listLeaderboardRecords` / `listTournamentRecords` + `*RecordsAroundOwner` (top-N + neighborhood, schema), writing via the `submit_score` RPC (`encode_record` → b64 → RPC). **Make `LeaderboardService` reads `await`-tolerant** (they're sync now; Nakama is async — call sites await a plain return safely). `set_backend(NakamaBackend)` once a session exists → the 3 leaderboard surfaces light up with real data. The submit path is then real (Trials/campaign scores post on match end).
3. **Matchmaking** (bigger; `matchmaking_orchestration.md`) — ticket + escalation → forming lobby (fill X/8, unanimous-or-auto-at-8, abstain=no, no timeout) → instant-join → hand clients the **Godot match server** address + `match_id`. **Prereq:** the Godot server (`deploy/`) currently runs ONE fixed match — it needs **concurrent matches keyed by match_id** (rooms). Authority stays in Godot (see arch call below); Nakama only matchmakes + points.

Gotchas to remember: no Docker/Node on the dev box (couldn't local-test the Nakama JS — verify on the box); the `submit_score` RPC trusts the client's re-sim'd score for the beta (server-side re-sim worker is deferred launch-hardening, blobs are already stored for it); Steam auth is a separate later task (GodotSteam SDK).

### ✅ §4.1 legality check (+ record serialization) — DONE 2026-06-08
The re-sim now **rejects tampered logs**, closing the second anti-cheat half (it already closed score injection; this closes *illegal* logs). All in `src/scripts/resim.gd` + the submit path, verified headless.
- **`_apply` validates every action at its tick** against the replayed authoritative state and returns a reason on failure (nothing is applied when illegal): `place` (bool of `bot_place_tower` = affordability + `_is_valid_placement`), `sell` (`_sell_tower_at_cell` false ⇒ no tower), `upgrade` (tower exists + `can_upgrade` not-maxed + `can_afford` — previously force-spent), unknown action type, bad seat. **Phase gate:** place/sell/upgrade rejected at any `phase == "run"` tick.
- **`run()` returns `legal: bool` + first-illegal `{tick, seat, action, reason}`**; the first illegal action stops the replay. **Submit path** (`scene_manager._authoritative_score`/`report_match_result`) now returns `{score, legal}` and **writes no score** when illegal.
- **Record serialization:** `Resim.encode_record`/`decode_record` (`var_to_bytes`/`bytes_to_var`; Vector2i cells; ~2.5 KB/record) — the wire/store format for the submit path.
- **Verified** (`src/tools/sim_harness.gd`, 5 checks ✅): honest round-trip (re-sim==live, dmg=54985) · serialize→deserialize identical · two tampered copies rejected (occupied cell ⇒ `illegal_place`; build action at a run tick ⇒ `phase_gate`) · inflated claim ignored · illegal log writes no score. **Note:** the check exposed that the harness had been applying *free* upgrades (direct `t.upgrade()` bypassing gold) — fixed to pay through the real economy, which dropped the honest baseline from an inflated 69962 to a legitimate 54985.

### ▶ Nakama meta backend — IN PROGRESS 2026-06-08 (stack authored; deploy gated on box resize)
Bringing the leaderboard service's backend online (and, after, matchmaking). **Decisions (2026-06-08):** self-host Nakama on the **existing Hetzner box** (178.156.171.215), **resized to ~8 GB** (current CPX11/2 GB is too tight for Nakama+Postgres next to the match sim) — Heroic Cloud rejected on cost (~3–5×). **Device-auth first, Steam later.** Scope = **leaderboards + matchmaking** (leaderboards first).
- **Architecture call (resolves a doc conflict):** match **authority stays in the headless Godot server**; **Nakama = meta/matchmaker only** (it hands clients a `match_id`/address). Picks `remote_beta_plan.md`'s "lower-code" path over `matchmaking_orchestration.md`'s Nakama-Go-handler suggestion — rewriting the verified GDScript coordinator in Go is wasteful. (orchestration doc explicitly allows this: "only where the code runs changes.")
- **CC AUTHORED — `deploy/nakama/`** (ready to deploy, not yet live): `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 16 + Nakama 3.22.0, private Postgres, ports 7349/50/51), `data/modules/index.js` (JS runtime — idempotently creates **5 campaign leaderboards + ranked_s1 + 60 Trials tournaments** per `leaderboard_schema.md` with UTC reset crons, plus an authoritative **`submit_score` RPC** that writes server-side + stashes the match record blob for the later re-sim worker — the real wire format, validator deferred = "no disposable intermediates"), `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `README.md` (resize + Docker + deploy + verify). **Couldn't local-test** (no Docker/Node on the dev box) — verified by hand against the 3.x runtime API; real verify is on deploy.
- **▶ NEXT — USER provisions (gating):** resize the box to CPX31/CCX13 (~8 GB), `curl get.docker.com | sh`, open TCP 7350 (+7351 to your IP), then `docker compose up -d` per `deploy/nakama/README.md`. Then **CC builds** (against the live instance so it's testable): the nakama-godot client + device auth (`NakamaClient` autoload) → a **`NakamaBackend`** for `LeaderboardService` (reads via list/around-owner, writes via `submit_score`) → `set_backend()` it and the 3 leaderboard surfaces light up with real data → then **matchmaking** (ticket→forming-lobby→hand off to the Godot server, which then needs concurrent-match support).

### ✅ Leaderboard UI surfaces (3 of 4) + data-service seam — DONE 2026-06-08
Built `notes/leaderboard_ui_spec.md` Surfaces 1/3/4 against a backend-abstracted service — **the seam Nakama plugs into with zero UI rework.**
- **`src/scripts/leaderboard_service.gd`** (NEW): the single read API every surface uses. Owns store-independent logic (board-id naming `trials_<window>_<scale>_<group>`, scale/window names, **UTC reset countdowns** per schema §5.1, Ranked tier→band math) and delegates the row fetch to a swappable backend. Ships **`LocalBackend`** — honest: real local best scores (`SaveData`) + live countdowns, **empty competitor lists** (correct pre-server, not a placeholder). `set_backend(NakamaBackend.new())` later lights everything up. Static-only (no autoload).
- **Surface 3 — `leaderboard_browse.gd` (NEW) + scene + home button:** the hub. Category seg Trials/Ranked/Campaign; Trials = window tabs + countdown + group seg + scale pills + ranked rows w/ jump divider + your green row; Ranked = season seg + your-standing card + one continuous tiered-**band** ladder (Masters→Bronze, colored tags); Campaign = per-mission boards. Empty-states where there's no local data. Deep-linkable via `SceneManager.goto_leaderboards(ctx)`.
- **Surface 4 — `pve_select.gd`:** cards renamed Scale 1–5 → **Thread/Weave/Tangle/Snarl/Knot**; inline live-rank chip ("#14 ›") that taps through to that board. (Also satisfies part of the locked scale-name label-pass.)
- **Surface 1 — `match_end_panel.gd`:** Trials-only post-match placement block (board context · "You placed #N today" · neighborhood ±2 · **View full board**), below the tier strip; panel now sizes to content. Wired via `match_end.lb_ctx` from map_loader (PVE only; campaign unchanged).
- **Deferred — Surface 2 (Ranked post-match LP/placement):** needs the real LP engine + placement from a networked Ranked match; do it with the MP/Nakama work.
- **Verified** (`src/tools/leaderboard_test.{gd,tscn}`, headless, **26 checks ✅**): service logic (naming/bands/countdowns) · LocalBackend honesty (empty vs own-entry) · browse renders all 3 categories with an injected sample backend (jump divider, category/selection switches) · entry points (select builds; PVE match-end gets lb_ctx + renders rows; campaign does not). Screenshots (`leaderboard_shot`) eyeballed vs mockups. ghost_ladder/campaign_verify/sim_harness still green.
- **`ui_style.gd`:** added public `flat_box()` for one-off row/tag surfaces.

### ✅ Ghost ladder (in-match target display) — DONE 2026-06-08
Built `notes/ghost_ladder.md` for Trials (PVE). The in-match SCORE pill's target line now climbs a merged ascending ladder instead of medals-only: **named tier → ghost score → your best → TOP**, never asserting a live rank in-match.
- **`src/scripts/ghost_ladder.gd`** (NEW, `GhostLadder` RefCounted): `setup(b,s,g, ghosts, own_best)` builds the rung list (named tiers below gold ++ snapshot ghost scores above gold); `target_for(score)` returns `{state,target,label,name}` driving the 4 states; `passed()`/`rung_count()` for the optional counter. **Snapshot source is a stub** — `fetch_snapshot()` returns `[]` (no Nakama yet), so offline play correctly falls through to YOUR BEST / TOP (population-independent by design); the GHOST state lights up unchanged when the backend lands.
- **`hud.gd`** — SCORE pill target line routes through `ghost_ladder` when set (medal icon only in named-tier states; badge text carries GHOST/YOUR BEST/TOP). Persistent **"standings as of match start"** caption (the honesty contract). Campaign (`ghost_ladder == null`) keeps the medal-only target.
- **`map_loader.gd`** — `_build_ghost_ladder(map)` builds it for **PVE only** (own-best from `SaveData.best_pve_score`), assigned to HUD before add_child. **Removed the gold-reached "go home?" win panel for Trials** (`_build_match_ui` now gates `WinPanel` to CAMPAIGN) — a Trials run goes until its rounds are spent.
- **Verified** (`src/tools/ghost_ladder_test.{gd,tscn}`, headless, 19 checks ✅): full climb through all 4 states (sub-gold ghost ignored) · dead-board + brand-new-player fallbacks · passed()/rung_count() · wiring (PVE HUD has a ladder + no win panel; campaign has neither change). campaign_verify + sim_harness still green.
- **Next when MP lands:** point `GhostLadder.fetch_snapshot()` at the cached per-`(map,window,group)` leaderboard read; surface the live-rank reveal on the result screen (the only live number).

### ▶ NEXT SESSION — pick up the remaining resim_contract §10 tail + the two human items
The anti-cheat spine is now complete for solo Trials/PVE (determinism → record → re-sim → legality → authoritative write, all verified). What's left:
- **Submit path plumbing** — `encode_record` exists but nothing calls it yet; the actual Trials submit (record → bytes → server/Nakama) is a networked-MP task, sequenced with the orchestration spine.
- **Ranked placement** still reads the live coordinator (authoritative offline; networked host-side re-sim is a later MP task).
- **Wire the real server seed** into `sim_seed` (today = map.seed).

**Two items that want Tobe (not blocking code):**
- **`end`-action nod** — the "locked" §9.2 vocab was extended with an `end` bow-out marker (flagged in `resim_contract.md`). Needs an OK or a different call.
- **Human playtest** — drive a real match interactively; the tick logic is exhaustively verified headless but the live UI/fast-forward path wasn't. De-risks the whole refactor; worth doing before building more on top.

---

- **CC — sim determinism conversion: DONE ✅ (2026-06-07).** The re-sim prerequisite (§5) is built and verified:
  - **§5.1 cross-platform float test:** floats bit-identical across Win/Mac/Linux-glibc → built on `float`, no fixed-point. Probe `src/tools/float_probe.gd` + CI guard `.github/workflows/float-probe.yml`; evidence `notes/float_probe_results.md`. (Caveat: if the prod re-sim server is musl/Alpine, add a musl CI leg — glibc-only doesn't clear musl's libm.)
  - **Fixed logical tick:** all sim subsystems now stepped by one fixed-timestep clock in `match_coordinator.gd` (`SIM_DT`, `sim_tick`, accumulator + `MAX_STEPS_PER_FRAME`). Towers/spawner/projectiles/mobs no longer self-`_process` — they expose `sim_step()` and are driven in a fixed order by `BoardState.sim_step` (spawn→towers→projectiles→mobs). Clients still sim locally (entity-step on every machine; clock host-only) so netcode is preserved.
  - **Seeded RNG, ordered draws:** the crit roll (was global `randf()`) now uses one per-match `coordinator.rng`, drawn in board→placement order. Only combat roll, so "all combat rolls seeded" is satisfied.
  - **Tick-based build timer:** `build_ticks_left` is authoritative; `build_time_left` (sec) is just the HUD mirror.
  - **Verified:** `src/tools/sim_harness.gd` (headless, tick-driven) runs a full 13-round match, **byte-identical across 2 runs**, 0 errors, build-timer auto-expiry exercised. Build-phase length proven not to leak into combat outcome.
- **CC — record capture + re-sim runner: DONE ✅ (2026-06-07).** resim_contract §2/§4/§7 built and round-trip verified:
  - **Record capture:** `coordinator.{record_enabled, input_log, map_ref, ruleset_version}` + `log_input(seat, action)` (stamps `sim_tick`) + `make_record()`. Capture sites: `build_controller._place_tower`/`_sell_tower_at_cell` (via `_log_action`), `tower.upgrade`, and `request_start_now`/`set_board_ready` (start/vote_start, §9.2). map_loader wires `sim_seed = map.seed`, `map_ref`, `record_enabled = true`.
  - **Re-sim runner:** `src/scripts/resim.gd` — rebuilds the map from `map_ref`, builds a headless match (recording off), replays the tick-tagged log through the same board entry points, derives per-board score.
  - **Round-trip verified** (`sim_harness.gd`, now a capture→re-sim test): a 13-round match with 42 logged actions across rounds (incl. a round-2 placement at tick 3559) re-sims to the **exact same score** (dmg=69962, kills=485). This is the keystone property — the leaderboard number is the re-sim's, and it matches honest play.
- **CC — wire outputs: DONE ✅ (2026-06-07).** `SceneManager.report_match_result` now records the **re-sim-derived** score, never the live client tally: it re-sims `active_coordinator`'s record (set in `main.gd`) and writes that to SaveData (campaign medal / PVE best). The live tally is advisory/UX only. A mid-match bow-out logs an `end` marker so re-sim scores the partial (new `end` action — extends §9.2, flagged in `resim_contract.md` for review). **Verified** (`sim_harness.gd`): handed an inflated claim of 99,999,999, SaveData stored the honest 69,962 — "you can't write score = 9,999,999." Locally the re-sim runs client-side as the server stand-in + a determinism self-check (`push_warning` if it ever disagrees).
  - **Remaining (resim_contract §10):** solo-log **legality check** (§4.1) **DONE 2026-06-08** (see "Next step") · **record serialization** **DONE** (`Resim.encode_record`/`decode_record`); the actual **submit** wiring (record → bytes → server) is still a networked-MP task · **Ranked placement** still reads the live coordinator (authoritative for offline; networked host-side re-sim is a later MP task). Also: wire the real server seed into `sim_seed` (today = map.seed); bot upgrade-pick uses unseeded `randi()` (`bot_controller.gd:154`) — fine, bot matches are never re-simmed.
  - **Needs a human:** real interactive playtest to confirm the live (frame-accumulator) path *feels* right — tick logic is exhaustively verified but the in-app UI/fast-forward flow wasn't driven headless.
- **CC label-pass (mechanical):** Scale 1–5 → Thread/Weave/Tangle/Snarl/Knot across `design/DESIGN_MODES.md` + `design/VISUAL_SYSTEM.md`; remove the Trials "go home?" prompt. (Deliberately not done at wrap to avoid full-rewrite drift.)
- **CC — campaign rebuild: DONE ✅ (2026-06-08).** Five-mission curriculum per `design/CAMPAIGN.md`, built + headless-verified:
  - **Maps** live in `src/campaign/` (the doc's `levels/campaign/` path was wrong). `mission_01–05.tres` rewritten to ramp from zero (M1 0CP full-ghost · M2 2CP first-segment ghost · M3 3CP hint ghost · M4 1CP + 4 zones · M5 3CP + 5 zones integration). `mission_06–10.tres` deleted; `CAMPAIGN_MISSION_COUNT`/`CAMPAIGN_MISSIONS`/`campaign_select.LESSONS` trimmed to 5. Tuning + B/S/G are **gentle uncalibrated stubs** (await the 25×14 retune + playtest).
  - **Tutorial-beat schema (reopen → resolved):** an array of `TutorialBeat` sub-resources on `MapResource.tutorial_beats` (mirrors `bonus_zones`/`obstacles`; generated maps leave it empty). `TutorialBeat` = trigger/text/anchor/ghost_cells/blocking.
  - **Runtime (local board, CAMPAIGN only):** `TutorialDirector` maps match signals → 7 triggers (one-shot); `TutorialCallout` = anchored toast + blocking modal (pauses tree for M1's opener); `BuildGuide` = dashed-tile + 40%-alpha-footprint ghost outline, clears a cell on build. No new art. Callouts are positioned (no pointer-arrows yet — deferred polish).
  - **Verified** (`src/tools/campaign_verify.gd`, headless): all 5 parse, every ghost-cell set is a legal maze (path stays open), director/callout/overlay build end-to-end. **Needs a human:** M1's blocking opener (pause→"Got it"→resume) isn't auto-testable headless — confirm in playtest.
- **Design — remaining big pieces:** juice/game-feel pass · Steam closed-beta mechanics · season-pass numbers · GTM. No design piece is currently blocking CC — the orchestration + campaign specs give CC a full plate.
- Still needs two humans: a real 2-client cross-network match (targets the end-state stack).
