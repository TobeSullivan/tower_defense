## Current focus

**Map resource framework built and verified (Claude Code, 2026-05-30).** The mission/map resource architecture from `DESIGN_MODES.md` is now implemented in Godot:
- `GameConstants` autoload holds all global tuning (economy, build timings, mob HP growth, tower base stats, crit/multishot caps, upgrade ramp, lives). Registered in `project.godot`.
- `MapResource` + `ZoneDefinition` resource schemas (`src/resources/`). Per-map values (grid, layout, obstacles, zones, supply, rounds, thresholds) live here.
- `map_loader.gd` builds the live scene from any MapResource; `main.gd` is now a thin host that loads `mission_01.tres` via the loader.
- `mission_01.tres` hand-authored as the first campaign mission — validates the authoring workflow.
- `map_generator.gd` is a **stub** (returns a valid MapResource per the scale table; real procgen + constraint validation still TODO).
- All scripts refactored off hardcoded magic numbers. Verified with a headless run through build phase → run phase → round transition, zero errors.

**Note:** the locked schema stores obstacles as bare cells (`obstacle_cells: Array[Vector2i]`), so the textured multi-tile props (cars, dead trees) from the prototype are gone — each obstacle cell now renders a single debris prop. If richer obstacle visuals matter, the schema needs an `ObstacleDefinition` sub-resource (texture + footprint) — that would reopen the locked MapResource schema.

**UI/navigation Phase 1 done (2026-05-30).** Built the core navigation layer:
- `SaveData` autoload — JSON save at `user://save.json`; holds `first_launch_done` + campaign medals. `SceneManager` autoload — owns transitions, carries the chosen `MapResource` into the match via `pending_map`.
- `boot.tscn`/`boot.gd` — entry point (now `run/main_scene`); first launch sets the flag and drops into mission 1, every launch after opens the home screen.
- `home_screen` (Campaign live; PVE/PVP present but disabled — multiplayer deferred) and `campaign_select` (missions 1–10, all unlocked, best medal per mission; only mission 1 authored, 2–10 shown "Coming soon").
- `main.gd` now reads `SceneManager.pending_map` (falls back to mission 1 if launched directly). Match-end + win-panel exits route through `SceneManager.goto_home()` / `restart_current_match()`; campaign medals persist via `report_match_result`.
- Verified headless: first-launch→mission, returning→home, campaign_select builds, save file writes correctly.

**UI/navigation Phase 2 done (2026-05-30).** Pause menu (`pause_menu.gd`, built by `map_loader`):
- Owns the full Esc priority stack as the single arbiter — `build_controller` no longer handles Esc (exposes `is_build_mode`/`is_upgrade_panel_open`/`close_upgrade_panel`/`exit_build_mode` for the menu to drive). Order: upgrade panel → build mode → pause menu; Esc again resumes.
- SP (campaign / solo PVE) pauses the tree while open; MP does not (reads `SceneManager.current_is_multiplayer`). MP shows "Quit Match" with a context-aware PVP/PVE message; SP shows Restart + Quit to Menu. Both destructive actions go through a confirm dialog.
- Restart → `SceneManager.restart_current_match()`, Quit → `goto_home()`. Settings button present but disabled (Phase 3).
- Verified headless with a throwaway input harness: Esc toggles pause on/off and the quit-confirm dialog appears. Also fixed a real bug found via stderr capture — `boot.gd` called `change_scene_to_file` during `_ready` ("parent busy"); now deferred. See new memory [[reference-godot-headless-verify]].

**UI/navigation Phase 3 done (2026-05-30) — UI layer complete, AWAITING PLAYTEST.** Settings:
- `SaveData` now stores a `settings` dict (master/music/SFX volume, default game speed, fullscreen, resolution index, damage numbers), backfilled from `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` on load, applied at startup. `apply_audio` (guarded by bus existence — no Music/SFX buses yet, so those are inert until audio is added), `apply_display` (DisplayServer fullscreen + windowed resolution).
- `settings_panel.gd` — reusable CanvasLayer overlay (process ALWAYS, layer 40) openable from home screen and pause menu. Sliders/option buttons/checkboxes apply live; saves to disk on close. No own Esc handler — the opener (pause menu in-match, home screen otherwise) closes it on Esc, top of the priority stack.
- Default game speed applied via `Engine.time_scale` at match start (`main.gd`); reset to 1× on menu scenes (`SceneManager`). Damage-numbers toggle gates `mob.gd._spawn_damage_number`.
- Verified headless (stderr captured): boot paths, match+pause+settings build, settings round-trip (set→save→reload→read-back), and the full run phase with the damage-numbers gate. Save reset for a clean first-launch test.

**Committed** `66c5d17` on `main` (playtested & approved, 2026-05-30) — one cohesive commit (phases commingled within shared files, so a clean 4-way split wasn't practical). **Not yet pushed to origin.**

**Procgen done (2026-05-30).** `map_generator.gd` is now a real seeded generator (was a stub):
- Entry/exit on left/right edges; serpentine checkpoints (re-rolled toward a min path-length ratio); obstacles scattered and each validated against the pathfinder (kept clear of edge funnel); bonus zones with the first planted on the path corridor (reachability) and the rest enforcing ≤1 overlap (no 3-way overlap); per-map thresholds derived from path length (soft, tunable). Scale table drives supply/checkpoints/zones/mobs/rounds per tier. PVP omits thresholds.
- Verified via a throwaway harness: 100 maps (tiers 1–5 × 20 seeds) passed every DESIGN_MODES procgen constraint; determinism confirmed; a generated map loads + builds through `map_loader` (same path as campaign). Path/straight ratio avg 1.36.
- **Not yet reachable in-app** — there's no PVE/PVP entry to launch a generated map. The generator is validated infrastructure; wiring a playable PVE-solo entry (map select → generated map → match) is the obvious next step if you want to feel it in the real app.

**Playtest fixes round 2 (2026-05-31) — AWAITING RE-TEST, NOT COMMITTED.** Four more from the second PVE playtest:
1. **Partial scores count** — bowing out mid-match now records the current score. `SceneManager.report_match_result(damage)` computes the medal itself; new `leave_match_to_home(damage)` records-then-home, wired into the gold-reached popup (`win_panel`) and the pause-menu quit. Best-kept storage means a partial never beats a full run (the user's no-risk call). Pause SP quit message updated ("Your score so far is saved").
2. **Quit Game from main menu** — `home_screen` bottom-left button → `get_tree().quit()`.
3. **HUD "0/0" at start fixed** — the controller emits `towers_changed` before the HUD is in the tree, so the HUD now seeds count/cap from the controller on connect (shows e.g. `0 / 60`).
4. **Memory/near-crash — root-caused to render-side path overlay.** User confirmed it happened **while hovering in build mode** (no mobs/firing). Measured the hover path headless (dense 80-tower maze, 600 frames of validity + projected-path pathfinding): objects + memory **dead flat at 29.3 MB** — so the pathfinder/logic does NOT leak. Real cause: `build_controller` repainted the whole maze path **every frame** with `draw_line(antialiased=true)` — hundreds of AA segments/frame in the GL-compat renderer, and doubling supply made the maze path much longer, so it spiked. Fixes: **dropped antialiasing** on the dash draw and **throttled the overlay repaint to ~30fps**. Also kept (separate, still worthwhile): `mob.gd`/`death_fx.gd` now share one `SpriteFrames` instead of rebuilding per spawn/death — reduces run-phase churn, though it was NOT the hover cause.
   - **MUST re-verify on the real renderer**: hover in build mode on a dense Scale 4/5 map and watch memory. If it still climbs, the fallback is to replace the immediate-mode `_draw` overlay with a `Line2D` (set points once on path change) instead of redrawing every frame.

All code verified headless (builds clean; HUD cap correct; firing+deaths work with shared frames; partial score records; hover-path memory flat). The render fix itself can't be measured headless (dummy renderer). See [[reference-godot-headless-verify]].

**Playtest fixes round 1 (2026-05-31).** Four changes from the first PVE playtest, on top of the PVE-solo work below:
1. **Supply doubled** — PVE scale table now 20/40/60/80/100 (was 10–50); campaign `mission_01` cap 50→100. The 40×22 map was too big to maze with the old supply. (Generated thresholds scale with supply, so they roughly doubled too — still soft.)
2. **Checkpoint count shown** on PVE map cards alongside rounds/supply/zones/mobs.
3. **Upgrade panel clamped on-screen** (`upgrade_panel._position_near`) — flips to the tower's left near the right edge and clamps into the viewport, so towers near any edge no longer hide part of the panel.
4. **Breakpoint-tuned upgrades** — replaced the flat +10%/tier with per-stat increments in GameConstants. Damage `0.34`/tier anchored to base-mob (100 HP) shots-to-kill: tier 1 → 3 shots, tier 3 → 2, tier 9 → 1 (verified via harness). Attack speed `0.15`/tier (extra-shot crossings sooner; placement-dependent). Range stays `0.10`. Crit/multishot unchanged (already discrete/probabilistic).

All verified headless (builds clean; breakpoint table confirmed). Awaiting the user's re-test of feel before commit.

---

**PVE-solo built (2026-05-30).** Generated maps are now playable:
- Home `PVE` button enabled → `pve_select` scene: 5 maps (Scale 1–5) seeded from the current date (`hash(window_date) + tier`), so the set is stable per day and changes daily — locally, no backend. Each card shows rounds/supply/zones/mobs + local best score. `SceneManager.start_pve_map` → match (solo = single-player pause variant).
- `SaveData` stores local PVE best scores per `window_date|tier` (`record_pve_score`/`best_pve_score`); `SceneManager.report_match_result` records PVE scores (campaign still records medals).
- Reuses generator + loader + match + pause + settings unchanged. Verified headless: select builds 5 maps, a generated map loads (24 nodes), score round-trips.
- **Caveats:** (1) generated thresholds are very high/uncalibrated (Scale 3 gold ~656k) — fine for PVE since it's high-score-driven and medals are stretch goals, but needs playtest calibration; (2) the campaign-style gold-reached early-win popup is technically still active in PVE but effectively never fires given the high thresholds (leave unless it misbehaves); (3) only the daily window is implemented (weekly/monthly + leaderboards/lobbies remain deferred).

**Next build focus:**
- Threshold calibration once real PVE scores exist (lower `THRESHOLD_COVERAGE` or rework formula).
- Audio bus layout + actual sounds (would make Music/SFX volume sliders live).
- Full PVE (weekly/monthly windows, lobby, leaderboards) and PVP backends — deferred (multiplayer).

## UI/Navigation design session — 2026-05-30

Key decisions locked:

### First-launch flow
- Single boolean `first_launch` written to save data on first launch
- First launch: skip home screen, load mission 1 directly
- Player can Esc → Quit to Menu at any time — lands on home screen
- No requirement to complete mission 1; flag is set on launch, not completion
- All subsequent launches go straight to home screen

### Home screen
- Two primary buttons: **PVE** and **PVP**
- Season progress bar + tier badge: slim, top of screen, ambient not dominant
- Campaign: tertiary button, clearly secondary — it's a tutorial, not the product
- Settings: tucked away
- All in-match exits (win modal, pause menu quit) land here

### Campaign navigation
- All 10 missions unlocked from the start — no sequential gating
- Difficulty curve is guidance, not a gate

### PVE navigation
- Solo player: map select → straight into match
- Group: map select → brief lobby (invite + team/individual vote + ready up) → match

### PVP navigation
- One button: Find Match → queued

### Pause menu
- Esc priority stack: upgrade panel → build mode → pause menu
- Single player: pauses tree; options: Resume / Settings / Restart / Quit to Menu
- Multiplayer: does NOT pause tree; options: Resume / Settings / Quit Match
- Restart only available in single player
- Both Restart and Quit to Menu require confirm dialogs
- PVP quit dialog: "You will be eliminated and your lives will leave the pool"
- PVE quit dialog: "Your score will not be posted"
- Settings: master/music/SFX volume, default game speed, fullscreen, resolution, damage numbers toggle

### Specialization removed
- No specialization, no evolution, no milestone effects — ever
- May revisit post-launch if players explicitly request it
- Removed from DESIGN.md; added to anti-goals

## Mode design session — 2026-05-30

Full mode design locked. Key decisions: Campaign (solo, 10 missions, tutorial function), PVE (1–4 players, 5 maps per window, scale 1–5, daily/weekly/monthly), PVP (8 players, solo queue, pairwise lives transfers, LP ranking, seasonal resets), Seasons (free battle pass, cosmetic rewards, Masters rank number permanent on cosmetic), MapResource architecture, GameConstants autoload. All in `DESIGN_MODES.md`.

---

## Next step

**For Claude Code:** ✅ The 7-step map-resource framework below is DONE and verified (2026-05-30). Kept here for reference.

1. ✅ `src/resources/game_constants.gd` — autoload singleton, all global magic numbers moved in
2. ✅ `src/resources/map_resource.gd` — MapResource schema (note: `Window` enum renamed `WindowType` — shadowed native class; `bonus_zones` left untyped to dodge the cross-script typed-array pitfall)
3. ✅ `src/resources/zone_definition.gd` — ZoneDefinition sub-resource
4. ✅ `src/scripts/map_loader.gd` — reads MapResource, builds scene
5. ✅ `main.gd` — thin host, loads `mission_01.tres` via loader
6. ✅ `src/campaign/mission_01.tres` — first campaign mission, hand-authored
7. ✅ `src/scripts/map_generator.gd` — stub (real procgen TODO)

Next candidates (pick one): real procgen in `map_generator.gd` per the "Procgen constraints" spec; or the home-screen / mode-select scene so `main.gd` stops hardcoding mission 1.

**For this Claude (design):**

- Leaderboard backend design (captured in `notes/leaderboards.md` — needs updating with mode decisions)
- PVP LP curve (exact points per placement TBD)
- Season pass point values and milestone thresholds
- Damage threshold calibration (needs real playtest data)
- Soft caps for damage / range / attack_speed upgrade stats
